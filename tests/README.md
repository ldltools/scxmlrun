To run test cases in this directory, you need a small utility program called [shelltest](https://github.com/simonmichael/shelltestrunner),
which can be installed
by running `apt-get install shelltestrunner`.

Once installed, you can apply each of \*.conf files in this directory to the program,
or simply do the following

```
$ make test
```
